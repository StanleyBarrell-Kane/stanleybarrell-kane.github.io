\subsection {{Inequality and Economic Growth: Beyond the Median}\hfill September 2021 - March 2022}
\subtext{Bachelor's thesis}
\begin{zitemize}

\item The first section of the dissertation required replicating Alesina and Rodrikâ€™s 1994 paper \emph{"Distributive Politics and Economic Growth"}. I then conducted a review of the relevant academic literature between 1956-2018, and addressed differences in methodology over time
\item I constructed a short panel of 120 countries with information on levels of income and wealth inequality, levels of human capital, fertility rates, and political instability
\item I used system GMM estimation in STATA, as well as a series of robustness and sensitivity checks in R, to obtain results consistent with the most recent research on the topic, though diverging with the results of several papers from the 2000s. I extended on existing literature by considering quantile ratios and new wealth inequality data
